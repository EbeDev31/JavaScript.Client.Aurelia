## Background

When using [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io) as your frontend framework and want to have the building blocks from Dolittle more
accessible. This project gives you that.

The source code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/dolittle-interaction/JavaScript.Client.Aurelia).

## Package

The bridge is installed as an Aurelia plugin using NPM package:

```shell
$ npm i @dolittle/aurelia
```

or

```shell
$ yarn add @dolittle/aurelia
```
